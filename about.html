                <h2>ZUBANA</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Zubana, a student at The New School. Despite not delving into formal music studies,
                    my life has always been immersed in the diverse world of music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve always been excited to connect my experiences to music. I've often found myself in the
                    role of that friend who introduces others to fresh tunes, broadening their music taste
                    beyond their usual preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm excited to channel this passion into my blog. The goal is simple: to assist others
                    in discovering new music that resonates with them. I hope this blog inspires you to explore
                    and expand your musical palette.
